Car Rental System

This project is a Car Rental System designed to simplify the car rental process for users. It provides a user-friendly interface for renting cars, managing rentals, and viewing available vehicles. The project utilizes several design patterns and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern to ensure scalability, maintainability, and modularity.

Features

User registration and login functionality

Car rental with pricing model selection

Real-time budget management

Filtering and viewing available cars

Undo/redo functionality for rental cancellations

Admin panel for car management (add, modify, remove)

Observer pattern for real-time updates on budget and UI elements

Project Structure

The project is structured around the MVC architecture:

Model

The model layer contains the core business logic and data structures:

User: Represents user data and manages observers for budget updates.

Car: An interface representing different car types (e.g., SUV, Sedan, Hatchback).

PricingStrategy: Defines strategies for calculating rental prices (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).

Decorators: Enhances cars with additional features like full fuel or insurance.

View

The view layer manages the graphical user interface using Swing components:

LoginView: User login interface.

RegisterView: User registration form.

WelcomeView: Main menu for users.

RentCarView: Car rental interface.

RentedCarsView: Displays user's rented cars and allows actions like cancellation or return.

AdminView: Admin interface for managing cars.

Controller

The controller layer connects the view and model layers, handling user actions and updating the view:

LoginController: Handles login and registration logic.

RentCarController: Manages the car rental process.

RentedCarsController: Handles actions on rented cars (cancel, return, undo).

AdminController: Enables admins to add, modify, or remove cars.

Design Patterns

This project implements multiple design patterns to improve its structure and maintainability:

1. Singleton Pattern

Used in: SingletonConnection

Ensures a single instance of the database connection is shared across the application.

2. Command Pattern

Used in: CancelRentalCommand, CommandInvoker

Encapsulates rental operations (cancel, undo) as commands, enabling undo/redo functionality.

3. Factory Pattern

Used in: CarFactory

Simplifies the creation of car objects based on their type (e.g., SUV, Luxury, Sedan).

4. Strategy Pattern

Used in: PricingStrategy

Defines pricing models (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) as interchangeable strategies.

5. Decorator Pattern

Used in: CarDecorator, FullFuelDecorator, InsuranceDecorator

Dynamically adds features to cars, such as full fuel or temporary insurance.

6. Observer Pattern

Used in: User (as Subject), Views (as Observers)

Updates views in real time when the userâ€™s budget changes.

7. Facade Pattern

Used in: CarRentalFacade

Simplifies interactions between controllers and services by providing a unified interface.
